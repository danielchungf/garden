I was not supposed to attend [Tokyo Design Forum](https://www.tokyodesignforum.com/). But I'm glad I did.

A few months ago, [Gabe Valdivia](https://x.com/gabrielvaldivia) told me he was speaking at a design conference in Tokyo. I was immediately drawn to it. I'm a designer who loves Japanese culture—I grew up slurping cold somen noodles during hot summers, spent countless days watching my parents play tennis against my aunties and uncles at a Japanese club in Lima, and even won a singing contest in Japanese when I was 4. But I had never set foot in Japan. Until last week.

Naturally, attending Tokyo Design Forum (TDF) sounded like a great idea—I'd meet amazing designers in the city I've always wanted to visit since I was a kid. But here's the thing: we had already planned a three-week trip to Japan in late March, just one month after the forum. Two Japan trips, a month apart? That sounded crazy.

It wasn't until early January that I decided I had to go. And I owe it to [Jeff Smith](https://x.com/j_smith), who offered to [sponsor](https://x.com/j_smith/status/2006069886221476023) me and two other junior designers by giving us a free ticket after a short application process. I only had one month to buy plane tickets, book accommodation, finish my portfolio, and prepare to introduce myself to a room full of designers I'd been following on Twitter.

By the first day of the forum, I was convinced it was totally worth it, even if I'd had to pay for it. And it came down to two things: location and format. Last May, I went to [Config](https://config.figma.com/)—arguably the *biggest* design conference out there. Thousands of designers and non-designers, an enormous venue, multiple talks running simultaneously. Even though I had a great time, it felt scattered, overwhelming and corporate. TDF felt completely the opposite—it's an independent design gathering, meant to be small and intimate. Fifty designers in one small room, nowhere to hide. By day two, every face felt familiar.

Tokyo is far enough from almost everywhere that the effort feels intentional and authentic. Twenty-plus hours of flight time for some, you don't make that trip casually. Everyone there meant to be there. And the city itself made everything feel surreal—so alive and vibrant, that I couldn't grasp what I was doing *there*.

## The talks

I already knew Gabe's talk beforehand—I'd helped him create some assets for the presentation. His message was about building with intent in the age of AI. How do we decide what technology is worth making? Too many designers are building AI tools without asking _why_, without giving careful thought about what values are embedded in their products.

> *As designers, builders, and technologists, our responsibility is not only to solve problems. It is to protect and design the practices that make us human with the products we build.*

That's exactly how I feel. Technology should transform how we live, bring communities closer, and make us more human. Not just more efficient.

Another talk that struck me was [Kevin Twohy](https://x.com/kevintwohy)'s. It was all about the "New Creative Director", as he began referring to his role when working with early-stage teams. As design partners for startups, we often need to wear as many hats as possible, from social media to landing page design, to email marketing and packaging. Kevin shared how he had to teach himself dozens of disciplines while working on [Board](https://board.fun/)—game design, 3D animation, sound design, and many others.

That resonated deeply with how I've been feeling about the work I want to do. We are tinkerers and inventors, and that means constantly learning things we don't know. What is more rewarding than spending an entire day unraveling a discipline you knew nothing about—and by the end of it, having something tangible to show? A prototype, a rough animation, a weird experiment. That's how new skills are born.
