## Why write?

I've been designing and building products for a while now, and I've found that writing helps me think more clearly about the work. This is a place to share those thoughts — on design, engineering, and the space in between.

## What to expect

I'll write about things I'm learning, problems I'm solving, and ideas I'm exploring. Some posts will be practical (how I built something), others more reflective (why I made certain decisions).

A few topics I'm interested in:

- **Design systems** — building tokens, components, and patterns that scale
- **AI-native interfaces** — what happens when the product *is* the conversation
- **Early-stage product work** — the unique constraints and opportunities of startups

## A quick note on the setup

This is powered by plain markdown files, written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and rendered by Next.js at build time. No CMS, no database — just files in a git repo. Push to deploy.

> The best writing tool is the one you already use every day.
